# Overview

This repo contains examples of complete profiles and materials used to build profiles for an anonymous submission.

## Materials

This repo contains the following materials:

- **full\_profile\_examples**: This folder contains screenshots of full profiles as they are presented to participants during the study. Profiles are divided by occupation and artifact condition. *Note: The specific images and names shown are not held constant but are from the pools of names and images included in this r\
epo (see section 4.3 for details)*
- **profile\_images**: This folder contains the three pools of profile images used to populate the profiles. Images are organized into pools based on the three possible image artifact conditions (consistent, intra-field, and inter-field). Each image pool contains 30 images (15 male images and 15 female images).
- **name\_lists**: This folder contains the list of gender netural first names and last names used to populate the profiles. 
- **interaction\_examples**: This folder contains screenshots the result of possible user interactions with the profile. During the study participants are able to expand the profile image and expand the experience section. *Note: the experience section is hidden until user's interact by expanding it.*
